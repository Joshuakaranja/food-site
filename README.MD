#### A practice project to help learn how to use README files on GitHub, April 11, 2025
#### By **Josh**

## Description
This project is a practice module for me as a learner to enable myself to get the real idea on how to push my work to GitHub and how to formalize a README project.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Push your project to GitHub using the following steps:
  * Initialize a Git repository in your project directory (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
  * Add your files to the staging area:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  * Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
  * Create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
    git push -u origin master
    ```
